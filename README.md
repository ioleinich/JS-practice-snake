Discussion:

I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, native JavaScript and jQuery. Prototype architecture was used as a specific feature of this application. 

Requirements:

This short JS game will return you to “Tetris games” time. Use “Up”, “Down”, “Left” and “Right” keys to control snake and catch apples.
